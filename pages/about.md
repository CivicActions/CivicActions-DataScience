CivicActions Data Science is an open project primarily developed by CivicActions 
Data Science team members.

We believe that understanding the problem comes first, way before any data is 
involved. This allows you to find the right data to solve the problem and makes 
the process more efficient. 

Please [let us know](https://datascience.civicactions.com/contact) what you find 
helpful, if there are resources we should include or if there are ways we can 
improve.
