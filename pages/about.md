CivicActions Data Science is an open project primarily developed by CivicActions 
team members. 


We are gathering information that we find useful for our team, and hope that it 
resonates with our clients and the broader community. We acknowledge that this 
resource is imperfect, impermanent and incomplete, and we encourage you to help 
make it better. There is a lot of great information about data science already 
freely available on the web. We aim to refer people to great resources, or build 
upon them.

Please [let us know](https://datascience.civicactions.com/contact) what you find 
helpful, if there are resources we should include or if there are ways we can 
improve.
