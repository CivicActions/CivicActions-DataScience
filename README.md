# CivicActions Data Science

This repository is for the Data Science team at CivicActions.

## Contributing 

We want your input. We need your help to make this resource better. Please [submit a new issue](https://github.com/CivicActions/CivicActions-DataScience/issues/new/choose) or add to an existing one. We'd love to have more people fork this code and submit pull requests to make it better. We don't want to duplicate work done elsewhere, so we want to add references to other active projects that have open resources like this. 


## Development

If you want to replicate this site, you are free to do so. It is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site sitting on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). There are lots of resources that can help you learn how to fork this project and build on it.
